# Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.
#
# Example:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
# Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
# Explanation: 
#
# Window position                Max
# ---------------               -----
# [1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
#  1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
#  1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
#  1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
#  1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
#  1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
#
#
# Note: 
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ input array's size for non-empty array.
#
# Follow up:
# Could you solve it in linear time?
