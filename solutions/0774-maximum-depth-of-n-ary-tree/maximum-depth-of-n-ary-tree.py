# Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.
#
# The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
#
# Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
# Output: 3
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
#
#
# Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
# Output: 5
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
# 	The total number of nodes is between [0, 104].
