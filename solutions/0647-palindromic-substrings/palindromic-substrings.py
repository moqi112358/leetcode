# Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this string.
#
# The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: "abc"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
#
#
# Â 
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: "aaa"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
#
#
# Â 
#
# Note:
#
#
# 	The input string length won't exceed 1000.
