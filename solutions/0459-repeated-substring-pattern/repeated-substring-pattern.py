# Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.
#
# Â 
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: "abab"
# Output: True
# Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: "aba"
# Output: False
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: "abcabcabcabc"
# Output: True
# Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)
