# Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
# Output: [[1,5]]
# Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
#
# NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.
