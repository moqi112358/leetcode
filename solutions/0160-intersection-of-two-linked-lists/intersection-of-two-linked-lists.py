# Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
#
# For example, the following two linked lists:
#
#
# begin to intersect at node c1.
#
#  
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
# Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
# Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
# Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
#
#  
#
# Example 2:
#
#
#
# Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
# Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
# Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
#
#
#  
#
# Example 3:
#
#
#
# Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
# Output: null
# Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
# Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
#
#
#  
#
# Notes:
#
#
# 	If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
# 	The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
# 	You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
# 	Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA, headB):
        if headA is None or headB is None:
            return None

        pa = headA # 2 pointers
        pb = headB

        while pa is not pb:
            # if either pointer hits the end, switch head and continue the second traversal, 
            # if not hit the end, just move on to next
            pa = headB if pa is None else pa.next
            pb = headA if pb is None else pb.next

        return pa # only 2 ways to get out of the loop, they meet or the both hit the end=None

# the idea is if you switch head, the possible difference between length would be countered. 
# On the second traversal, they either hit or miss. 
# if they meet, pa or pb would be the node we are looking for, 
# if they didn't meet, they will hit the end at the same iteration, pa == pb == None, return either one of them is the same,None
