# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
#
# (i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).
#
# You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: true
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: false
#
# Follow up:
#
#
# 	This is a follow up problem toÂ Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.
# 	Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
#

                    end = mid - 1
