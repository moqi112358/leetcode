# Given an integer array arr, count how many elements x there are, such that x + 1 is also in arr.
#
# If there're duplicates in arr, count them seperately.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: arr = [1,2,3]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: arr = [1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: No numbers are counted, cause there's no 2, 4, 6, or 8 in arr.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: arr = [1,3,2,3,5,0]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 0, 1 and 2 are counted cause 1, 2 and 3 are in arr.
#
#
# Example 4:
#
#
# Input: arr = [1,1,2,2]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Two 1s are counted cause 2 is in arr.
#
#
# Example 5:
#
#
# Input: arr = [1,1,2]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Both 1s are counted because 2 is in the array.
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	1 <= arr.length <= 1000
# 	0 <= arr[i] <= 1000
#
